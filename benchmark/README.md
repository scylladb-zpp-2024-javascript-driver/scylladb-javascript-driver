# Benchmarks for `Scylladb-javascript-driver`

A file that runs all benchmarks: `runner.py`

The script compares benchmark results for our driver, [DataStax Node.js driver](https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver) and [Rust driver](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver). Parameters for the benchmarks can be modified inside it. The result is a `graph.png` file that presents a graph of time on a logarithmic scale. The graphs are uploaded to the provided discord webhook.

The script uses an environment variable `SCYLLA_URI` - IP address of the Scylla database. Remember to start a database before.

For example:
```
SCYLLA_URI="172.17.0.2:9042" python3 benchmark/runner.py
```

## Benchmarks

Each benchmark recreates the table before execution to ensure consistent and isolated results.

Each of the JS benchmarks has an equivalent in Rust. For JS benchmarks, `driver` parameter determines which driver is tested. It can be `scylladb-javascript-driver ` or ` cassandra-driver`. 

Before running the benchmarks in Rust, remember to build them with flags `--bin -r`. 

Concurrent benchmarks in JS first create an array of queries, which are then executed by calling the `executeConcurrent` function. 
Rust benchmarks do not create an array to execute the queries. Queries are generated on the fly.

- **concurrent insert**

This benchmark uses `executeConcurrent` endpoint to insert `n` rows containing `uuid` and `int` into the database. Afterwards, it checks that the number of rows inserted is correct.

JS: 
```
node concurrent_insert.js <driver> <Number of queries>
```
Rust:
```
CNT=<Number of queries> cargo run --bin concurrent_insert_benchmark -r
```

- **insert**

This benchmark executes `n` `client.execute` queries, that insert a single row containing `uuid` and `int` waiting for the result of the previous query before executing the next one.


JS: 
```
node insert.js <driver> <Number of queries>
```
Rust:
```
CNT=<Number of queries> cargo run --bin insert_benchmark -r
```

- **concurrent_select**

This benchmark first inserts `10` rows containing `uuid` and `int`. Afterwards it uses `executeConcurrent` endpoint to select all of the inserted rows from the database `n` times.

JS: 
```
node concurrent_select.js <driver> <Number of queries>
```
Rust:
```
CNT=<Number of queries> cargo run --bin concurrent_select_benchmark -r
```


- **select**

This benchmark first inserts 10 rows containing `uuid` and `int`. Afterwards it executes `n` `client.execute` queries, that select all of the inserted rows, waiting for the result of the previous query before executing the next one.

JS: 
```
node select.js <driver> <Number of queries>
```
Rust:
```
CNT=<Number of queries> cargo run --bin select_benchmark -r
```
