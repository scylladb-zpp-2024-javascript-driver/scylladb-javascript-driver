/**
 * Translates IP addresses received from Cassandra nodes into locally queryable
 * addresses.
 *
 * The driver auto-detects new Cassandra nodes added to the cluster through server
 * side pushed notifications and through checking the system tables. For each
 * node, the address received will correspond to the address set as
 * `rpc_address` in the node yaml file. In most case, this is the correct
 * address to use by the driver and that is what is used by default. However,
 * sometimes the addresses received through this mechanism will either not be
 * reachable directly by the driver or should not be the preferred address to use
 * to reach the node (for instance, the `rpc_address` set on Cassandra nodes
 * might be a private IP, but some clients  may have to use a public IP, or
 * pass by a router to reach that node). This interface allows to deal with
 * such cases, by allowing to translate an address as sent by a Cassandra node
 * to another address to be used by the driver for connection.
 *
 * Please note that the contact points addresses provided while creating the
 * {@link Client} instance are not "translated", only IP address retrieve from or sent
 * by Cassandra nodes to the driver are.

 * - addresses in the same EC2 region are <strong>translated to private IPs</strong>
 *
 * This optimizes network costs, because Amazon charges more for communication over public IPs.
