Currently there is no examples showing usage of the driver. For examples from the DataStax driver, see ``./DataStax`` directory.

The ``basic.js`` example is a proof of concept connection to the database. It call the Rust layer directly, which will not be possible in the final package, as the rust layer will not be exposed in the API.
