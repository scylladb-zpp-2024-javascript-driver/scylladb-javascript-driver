This is a client-side driver for [ScyllaDB](https://www.scylladb.com/) written in Node.js.
This driver is an overlay over the [ScyllaDB Rust Driver](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-rust-driver),
with the interface based on the [DataStax Node.js Driver](https://github.com/datastax/nodejs-driver).
Although optimized for ScyllaDB, the driver is also compatible with [Apache CassandraÂ®].

This driver is currently in the experimental state.

API documentation is available [here](https://scylladb.github.io/nodejs-rs-driver/docs/). <!-- Note: update those links after first commit to new main -->

Book is available [here](https://scylladb.github.io/nodejs-rs-driver/book)

Each of the driver endpoint is listed and documented int the API documentation, while more in-depth look into the driver usage can be found in the book.

## Installation and build process

### Install dependencies

You can install required packages with the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

You also need to install [NAPI-RS cli](https://napi.rs/docs/introduction/getting-started#install-cli): 

```bash
npm install -g @napi-rs/cli
```

### Building

For build process use this command:

```bash
npm run build
```

If you want to build in development mode use this command:

```bash
npm run build:debug
```

## Testing the driver

### Test dependencies

Before running any of the tests, ensure the driver is built correctly.

For the integration tests you need to do the following steps before running tests:

1. Install [scylla-ccm](https://github.com/scylladb/scylla-ccm) package.
You may also use [ccm](https://github.com/riptano/ccm) but not all tests are guaranteed to pass while using it.
2. Have ``java-8`` installed and available in path ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-8`` (scylla-ccm uses this hardcoded path)

### Running the tests

You can run currently supported test with the following commands:

- Unit tests (``npm run unit``)
- Integration tests (``npm run integration``)

There are also some categories of unsupported tests. See `package.json` for a list of all possible commands.

## Running examples

Before running examples, you need to build the driver and install packages for the examples by running:

```bash
npm install
```

in ``./examples`` directory. You need also Cassandra or ScyllaDB running with at least three nodes (to ensure the replication_factor can be satisfied).
By default, examples assume the entrypoint for the database is ``172.17.0.2:9042`` but you can change it by setting ``SCYLLA_URI`` env variable.

You can run all examples with the following command:

```bash
npm run examples
```

This will check if all examples finished successfully, but will hide any output generated by the examples.

Alternatively you can run just a specific example by providing the path to it:

```bash
node ./examples/basic.js
```

## List of supported endpoints

The goal for this driver is to have the same interface as the DataStax Node.js driver.
You can find the current status for the endpoint compatibility in [this documentation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQyg-WhZaMVdBKttbDq7Iuec4KjoMJnU7XEGyiRBlgNubid8T7WqtAH1VDy32meQq5-04P72jLqhF3O/pubhtml#gid=2021765806).

## Not implemented functions

For functions not yet implemented:

```js
function functionName()) {
    throw new Error(`TODO: Not implemented`);
}
```

And for entities that will not be implemented:

```js
/**
 * @deprecated Not supported by the driver. Usage will throw an error.
 */
function entityName() {
  throw new ReferenceError(`entityName is not supported by our driver`);
}
```
